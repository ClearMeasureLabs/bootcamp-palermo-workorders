# Cloud Agent Instructions

- Stack: .NET 9.0, Blazor WASM + Server, EF Core 9, SQL Server, Onion Architecture
- Key paths: Core, DataAccess, UI Server/Client, Database scripts, Tests
- Architecture: Core has no deps; DataAccess references Core only; UI is outer layer
- Restrictions: no new NuGet packages or SDK upgrades without approval; no changes to `.octopus/` or build scripts without approval
- Code style: PascalCase types/methods, camelCase variables, nullable reference types, small methods, XML docs for public APIs
- Testing: NUnit + Shouldly only; test doubles use `Stub` prefix; AAA without comments; test names `[Method]_[Scenario]_[Expected]` and start with `Should` or `When`
- Database: migrations in `src/Database/scripts/Update/` with numbered `###_Name.sql`; use tabs in new SQL scripts
- Branching: when starting work on an issue, create branch `issues/[issue-number]/[issue-title]`; if branch exists, use it without creating a new one
- Quality gates: run `.`\privatebuild.ps1` before commit; run `.`\acceptancetests.ps1` before PR; docs-only changes skip builds; run `gh pr ready` when finished
- Responses: no anthropomorphizing; avoid first/second person; terse statements
